### Introduction
This meeting was our regular Tuesday session with the lecturer/project manager. Due to my concerns with my team member, I raised my voice and took a step further by addressing people above me, 
who have more control over the situation, to get them involved in solving these ongoing issues.
There were a few issues within the team. The major issue was communication and collaboration on the project. The other members' ideas weren't heard, and 
they couldn't brainstorm effectively with the team.

### Discussion Summary: 
* We discussed what we are going to do during the development phase. I left the choice to Alex because I was willing to give it a go and give him a chance to improve his communication and teamwork. 
However, Alex didn't seem to want to work as a team anymore, as he didn't say a single word until I mentioned that maybe we should work individually, to which he agreed.

* After the decision was made, we discussed how we are going to work individually. 
We both created separate GitHub repositories and invited our lecturer/project manager to be a part of them so they can monitor our progress and ensure that we meet our deadline with our tasks.

* I mentioned to John that I have made a few changes to the design, and what I need to do is to submit a change request outlining the following topics:
  1. Reason/Rationale for the change
  2. What is going to change
  3. Impact of the change on stakeholders
  
### Decisions Made
* we will work as individual to complete the developing of the software and presentation.
### Follow-Up Plan
* Client meeting on Friday to show our progress and keep them updated with the project.
