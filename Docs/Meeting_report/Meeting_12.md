### Introduction
This meeting combined a client meeting and a project management meeting. The purpose was to update the progress of the project and keep our client informed.
### Discussion Summary: 
I showed John what I have done so far with the project and gathered some feedback from him to improve the quality of the project. I had an issue with converting floats to decimals and ended up with numbers that didn't match the expected results. 
However, John redirected me by suggesting that I not change the format. Instead, he recommended displaying the numbers nicely after getting the calculations done. 
He also showed me a different way to use getter and setter methods to make the code look tidier with a few lines of code and demonstrated how he would write to display the result. We also briefly looked into the dashboard that I could use for this project.
  
### Decisions Made
Remove the formatting method in the calculation, and once it is working as expected, then add more functions such as overriding payments and balloon payments, etc.

### Follow-Up Plan
Aim to complete this function before Tuesday, 24/05, to be able to show John. I can then present it to the client, discuss any further improvements, 
and make changes if necessary during the client meeting.
