### Introduction
Final presentation for the project demonstration.

### Discussion Summary
* I wasn't able to demonstrate the complete project due to the incomplete part of updating the mortgage.
* At this stage, the project can only grab user inputs and calculate the initial payments, mortgage maturity, amortization schedule, and incremental projected planning.
* There are still a few things needed to be implemented into the project to enable users to update the mortgage, such as:
  - Users can add additional costs to the mortgage, which will increase the principal.
  - Users can make large one-time payments to reduce the principal amount significantly.
  - The final implementation of transaction history tracking.

### Decisions Made
Due to time limitations, I have run out of time to implement the last features into the mortgage update stage:
1. Users can add additional costs to the mortgage.
2. Balloon payments, allowing users to make a one-time payment to reduce the principal amount.
3. Display the transaction history with update dates such as 01/01/2026 and 01/01/2028.

Overall, the project needs to implement these features and provide more documentation for the final submission. This includes testing documentation, updating the README file, and project documentation.
